Then you can make one of these:

</p>

</p>


And it will control your Spark 40 amp!! 

It uses a ESP32-C3 Beetle - which is cheap and tiny!!    

The C3 is odd for uploading sketches - you need to link GPIO 9 to ground.
Also set 'Partition Scheme' to 'No OTA (2mb app/2mb spiffs)' and 'UBS CDC On Boot' to 'Enabled'


Parts:  
- Veroboard   
- 4 x 220ohm resistors   
- Wire   
- SSD1306   
- Beetle ESP32-C3 
- RS232 port breakout board (like this on Amazon "sourcing map D-sub DB9 Breakout Board Connector 9 Pin 2 Row Male RS232 Serial Port")
